## Available Form Collections

The following form collections support CSV export:

1. **Contact Forms** (`contact-forms`)
   - Fields: fullName, email, message, status, notes, createdAt, updatedAt
   - Status options: New, In Progress, Replied, Closed

2. **Donation Forms** (`donation-forms`)
   - Fields: fullName, email, donationAmount, paymentMethod, howDidYouHearAboutUs, status, transactionId, notes, createdAt, updatedAt
   - Status options: Pending, Processing, Completed, Failed, Refunded

3. **Booking Forms** (`booking-forms`)
   - Fields: fullName, email, phoneNumber, nationality, restaurant, reservationDate, reservationTime, numberOfGuests, specialOccasion, specialOccasionType, specialRequests, status, confirmationNumber, notes, createdAt, updatedAt
   - Status options: Pending, Confirmed, Seated, Completed, Cancelled, No Show

4. **In-Kind Support Forms** (`in-kind-support-forms`)
   - Fields: fullName, email, phoneNumber, deliveryPreference, message, status, itemType, estimatedValue, notes, createdAt, updatedAt
   - Status options: New, Contacted, Arranged, Completed, Declined

    "filters": {
      "status": {
        "equals": "completed"
      }
    }
  }'
```
